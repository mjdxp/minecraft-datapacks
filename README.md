# minecraft-datapacks
These datapacks are meant to improve crafting, and to make the game easier. Many blocks and items are too difficult to obtain in my opinion, so these packs can help. They are intended for 1.17 snapshots and onward, however they should be backwards compatible with older Minecraft versions.

<h2>Stone Improved</h2>
This datapack makes obtaining non renewable stone varients easier, as well as adds the ability to turn these stone varients into regular stone. This is a feature taken from the Legacy Console Edition, where Andesite, Diorite, and Granite could be used as substitutions for stone in crafting. Putting any of the below blocks into a stonecutter now allows you to turn them into stone:

- Andesite
- Diorite
- Granite
- Tuff
- Calcite

Crafting recipies have also been added to make non renewable stone blocks renewable. All recipies are shapeless.

- Blackstone can now be crafted with basalt and cobblestone. (While normally renewable through piglin trades, this adds an alternative method for getting large amounts of blackstone.)
- Calcite can be crafted with smooth basalt and diorite.
- Deepslate can be crafted with stone and blackstone.
- Netherrack can be crafted using a fire charge and eight pieces of cobblestone, giving eight pieces of netherrack.
- Tuff can be crafted with cobblestone and smooth basalt.

<h2>Plants Improved</h2>
This pack adds crafting recipies to make certain plants easier to obtain. All recipies are shapeless unless specified.

- Dead bushes can now be crafted with eight azalea bushes and a wither rose. This gives eight dead bushes. This recipie makes dead bushes renewable.
- Double ferns and double tall grass can now be obtained as items by crafting together two ferns or two pieces of tall grass. Normally, these cannot be obtained as items, except through villager house chests.
- Moss blocks can be crafted by putting nine vines in a crafting table, giving one moss block. In 1.17, moss blocks are difficult to come by, as you either need to come across them in shipwrecks or get lucky with a wandering trader. This allows you to obtain the first moss block more easily.
- Sea grass is craftable with eight pieces of tall grass and a water bucket. This is merely an alternative way to obtain it.
- Spore blossoms, which are normally not obtainable in survival, can now be crafted by putting a flowering azalea leaf block in the center of a crafting table, and putting four pink tulips around it in a cross shape. This makes them obtainable in 1.17 survival. (Note: This recipie is not shapeless.)
- Wither roses can now be crafted by putting a poppy in the center of a crafting table, and surrounding it with soul soil. (Due to an error, this recipie isn't shapeless.) This is intended so the player can get an initial wither rose to craft more with another recipie.
- Wither roses can also be crafted with eight poppies and one wither rose, which will turn the poppies into wither roses. This is an alternative for people who do not want to summon the Wither in their world, but still want access to the plant.
