# minecraft-datapacks
These datapacks are meant to improve crafting, and to make the game easier. Many blocks and items are too difficult to obtain in my opinion, so these packs can help. They are intended for 1.17 snapshots and onward, however they should be backwards compatible with older Minecraft versions.

<h2>Stone Improved</h2>
This datapack makes obtaining non renewable stone varients easier, as well as adds the ability to turn these stone varients into regular stone. This is a feature taken from the Legacy Console Edition, where Andesite, Diorite, and Granite could be used as substitutions for stone in crafting. Putting any of the below blocks into a stonecutter now allows you to turn them into stone:

- Andesite
- Diorite
- Granite
- Tuff
- Calcite

Crafting recipies have also been added to make non renewable stone blocks renewable. All recipies are shapeless.

- Blackstone can now be crafted with basalt and cobblestone. (While normally renewable through piglin trades, this adds an alternative method for getting large amounts of blackstone.)
- Calcite can be crafted with smooth basalt and diorite.
- Deepslate can be crafted with stone and blackstone.
- Netherrack can be crafted using a fire charge and eight pieces of cobblestone, giving eight pieces of netherrack.
- Tuff can be crafted with cobblestone and smooth basalt.

<h2>Plants Improved</h2>
This pack adds crafting recipies to make certain plants easier to obtain. All recipies are shapeless unless specified.

- Dead bushes can now be crafted with eight azalea bushes and a wither rose. This gives eight dead bushes. This recipie makes dead bushes renewable.
- Double ferns and double tall grass can now be obtained as items by crafting together two ferns or two pieces of tall grass. Normally, these cannot be obtained as items, except through villager house chests.
- Moss blocks can be crafted by putting nine vines in a crafting table, giving one moss block. In 1.17, moss blocks are difficult to come by, as you either need to come across them in shipwrecks or get lucky with a wandering trader. This allows you to obtain the first moss block more easily.
- Sea grass is craftable with eight pieces of tall grass and a water bucket. This is merely an alternative way to obtain it.
- Spore blossoms, which are normally not obtainable in survival, can now be crafted by putting a flowering azalea leaf block in the center of a crafting table, and putting four pink tulips around it in a cross shape. This makes them obtainable in 1.17 survival. (Note: This recipie is not shapeless.)
- Wither roses can now be crafted by putting a poppy in the center of a crafting table, and surrounding it with soul soil. (Due to an error, this recipie isn't shapeless.) This is intended so the player can get an initial wither rose to craft more with another recipie.
- Wither roses can also be crafted with eight poppies and one wither rose, which will turn the poppies into wither roses. This is an alternative for people who do not want to summon the Wither in their world, but still want access to the plant.

<h2>Difficult Obtains</h2>
This features misc crafting recipes for hard or impossible to obtain items. Note that items such as monster spawners, bedrock, and infested stone are not listed, as they can be somewhat game breaking and unbalanced if obtained by the player. All recipies are shapeless unless specified.

- The chorus plant block can be made with three chorus fruit and one chorus flower. The chorus plant block is normally only obtainable in the creative inventory. This recipie allows players to obtain it in survival.
- Clay can be crafted with a water bucket and eight sand blocks, yielding eight clay blocks. While clay is renewable through villager gifts, it can be difficult to get a lot of it this way. This makes it more easily renewable.
- Cobwebs can be crafted with nine pieces of string. Normally, cobwebs are a non renewable resource.
- Dragon's breath can be crafted with eight bottles and a chorus fruit. Normally, dragon's breath is renewable but a pain to get, as it requires respawning the dragon, which is very expensive and not usually worth the effort, making lingering potions generally not worthwhile.
- Farmland can be crafted with eight dirt blocks and a water bucket. As a block, farmland is normally only obtainable in creative.
- Hearts of the Sea can be crafted with a prismarine crystal in the center of the crafting table, with eight nautilus shells surrounding it. (This is not shapeless.) This makes hearts of the sea renewable.
- Petrified wood slabs can be crafted by surrounding a fire charge with oak planks. (Not shapeless.) Petrified wood slabs can normally only be obtained in creative, this recipie brings them to survival.
- A Pigstep music disk can be crafted with eight pieces of nether gold ore and chisled blackstone bricks. This is mostly just a joke recipie and may be changed or removed.
- Leather can now be crafted into rabbit hides. One leather gives two rabbit hide. This is to make crafting bundles easier without needing to build a rabbit farm.
- Sand can be crafted with two pieces of sand and two pieces of gravel, making four pieces of sand. Sand is normally renewable, but only via the wandering trader, which makes getting large amounts of it difficult.
- The snout banner pattern can be crafted with paper and chisled blackstone bricks. This makes it renewable.
- Sponges can now be crafted with a pufferfish and eight pieces of sand, yielding one sponge, making them renewable.
- Tridents can be crafted with three prismarine shards at the top of the crafting table, a heart of the sea in the center, and a stick below the heart. This recipie is intended to make tridents easier to obtain for people who do not want to deal with random drowned trident drops.
